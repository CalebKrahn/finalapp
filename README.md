# My Final App
## Caleb Krahn

### This is the website for my Final App in my CIS-277 Advanced C++ class.

## Description
This app is used to determine whether you need to take your garbage out or not. It does not take into account for holidays or delayed garbage days. The app should ask which day your garage is taken, then get what day of the week it is, then tell you whether you need to take your garbage out or not.







# Ignore this bit. It's so I know what to use for formatting.
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/CalebKrahn/finalapp/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown
